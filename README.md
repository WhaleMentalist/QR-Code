# QR-Code

This is just a challenege project from a website called Frontend Mentor. the objective to copy an interface as close as possible.

This was the design that the challenge wanted to mimic. The constraints were loose and frameworks such as Bootstrap are allowed, however, I opted to use plain CSS to accompolish the task.

After submitting the solution, I got some suggestions on how to improve the layout and responsivness. A big one was to remove my 'wrapper' divider element and apply the 'flexbox' to the 'body' element instead and to also use 'min-height' on the body instead of height. Another really helpful tidbit was to NOT use 'viewport' as a sizing attribute to the QR card, instead, specify a width and height using 'rem' or a percentage. You can then limit the size of the card using 'max-width' and 'max-height'. Suggestion is courtesy of 'https://github.com/Fahatmah'.
