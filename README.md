# QR-Code

This is just a challenege project from a website called Frontend Mentor. the objective to copy an interface as close as possible.

This was the design that the challenge wanted to mimic. The constraints were loose and frameworks such as Bootstrap are allowed, however, I opted to use plain CSS to accompolish the task. I ended up with a pretty decent final solution!
